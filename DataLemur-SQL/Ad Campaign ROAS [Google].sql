Google marketing managers are analyzing the performance of various advertising accounts over the last month. They need your help to gather the relevant data.

Write a query to calculate the return on ad spend (ROAS) for each advertiser across all ad campaigns. Round your answer to 2 decimal places, and order your output by the advertiser_id.

Hint: ROAS = Ad Revenue / Ad Spend

ad_campaigns Table:
Column Name	Type
campaign_id	integer
spend	     integer
revenue	     float
advertiser_id	integer

ad_campaigns Example Input:
campaign_id	spend	revenue	advertiser_id
1	          5000	     7500	     3
2	          1000	     900	     1
3	          3000	     12000	2
4	          500	     2000	     4
5	          100	     400	     4

Example Output:
advertiser_id	ROAS
1	0.9
2	4
3	1.5
4	4
Explanation
The example output shows that advertiser_id 1 returned 90% of their ad spend, advertiser_id 2 returned 400% of their ad spend, and so on.

The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!
