/*Each Facebook user can designate a personal email address, a business email address, and a recovery email address.

Unfortunately, the table is currently in the wrong format, so you need to transform its structure to show the following columns 
(see example output): user id, personal email, business email, and recovery email. Sort your answer by user id in ascending order.

users Table:
Column Name	Type
user_id	integer
email_type	varchar
email	varchar

users Example Input:
user_id	email_type	email
123	personal	hello@nicksingh.com
123	business	nick@datalemur.com
123	recovery	ns2se@virginia.edu
234	personal	aubrey1986@gmail.com
234	business	mgmt@ovo.com

Example Output:
user_id	personal	business	recovery
123	hello@nicksingh.com	nick@datalemur.com	ns2se@virginia.edu
234	aubrey1986@gmail.com	mgmt@ovo.com	

Explanation
This task is basically just asking you to pivot/transform the shape of the data. It's all the same data as the input above, just in different format.
Each row will represent a single user with all three of their emails listed. 
The first row shows User ID 123 (who may or may not be Nick Singh); their personal email is hello@nicksingh.com, their business email is nick@datalemur.com, and so on.
The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!*/

     , MAX(CASE WHEN email_type = 'personal' THEN email END) personal

     , MAX(CASE WHEN email_type = 'recovery' THEN email END) recovery
