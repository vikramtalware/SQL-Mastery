/*  You're given a list of numbers representing the number of emails in the inbox of Microsoft Outlook users. 
    Before the Product Management team can start developing features related to bulk-deleting email or achieving inbox zero, 
    they simply want to find the mean, median, and mode for the emails.

    Display the output of mean, median and mode (in this order), with the mean rounded to the nearest integer. 
    It should be assumed that there are no ties for the mode.

    inbox_stats Table:
    Column Name	Type
    user_id	integer
    email_count	integer

    inbox_stats Example Input:
    user_id	email_count
    123	    100
    234	    200
    345	    300
    456	    200
    567	    200

    Example Output:
    mean	median	mode
    200	    200	    200
    Explanation
    The mean is calculated by adding up all the email counts and dividing by the number of users, 
    resulting in a mean of 200 (i.e., (100 + 200 + 300 + 200 + 200) / 5).
    The mode is the value that occurs most frequently, which is 200 in this case, since it appears three times, more than any other value.
    The median is the middle value of the ordered dataset. When the data is arranged in order from smallest to largest 
    (100, 200, 200, 200, 300), the median is also 200, which separates the lower half from the higher half of the values.
    The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!
