/*
UnitedHealth Group (UHG) has a program called Advocate4Me, which allows policy holders (or, members) to call an advocate 
and receive support for their health care needs – whether that's claims and benefits support, drug coverage, pre- and post-authorisation, 
medical records, emergency assistance, or member portal services.

Write a query to obtain the number of unique callers who made calls within a 7-day interval of their previous calls. 
If a caller made more than two calls within the 7-day period, count them only once.

callers Table:
Column Name	Type
policy_holder_id	integer
case_id	varchar
call_category	varchar
call_date	timestamp
call_duration_secs	integer

callers Example Input:
policy_holder_id	case_id	call_category	call_date	call_duration_secs

15	06545ac5-18f5-4ae8-9b1e-087c7dc8deca	member portal	01/08/2023 03:19:24	973

Example Output:
policy_holder_count
2

Explanation:
Policy holder IDs 14 and 15 each made two calls within a 7-day interval. 
For example, ID 14 made calls on 02/17/2023 and 02/21/2023, and ID 14 on 01/08/2023 and 01/09/2023 consecutively. 
Hence, the count of unique callers is two.
The dataset you are querying against may have different input & output - this is just an example!
