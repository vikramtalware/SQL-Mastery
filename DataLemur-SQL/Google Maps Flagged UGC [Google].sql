/*As a Data Analyst on the Google Maps User Generated Content team, you and your Product Manager are investigating user-generated content (UGC) â€“ photos and reviews that independent users upload to Google Maps.

Write a query to determine which type of place (place_category) attracts the most UGC tagged as "off-topic". In the case of a tie, show the output in ascending order of place_category.

Assumptions:

Some places may not have any tags.
Each UGC upload with the "off-topic" tag will be counted separately.

place_info Table:
Column Name	Type
place_id	integer
place_name	varchar
place_category	varchar

place_info Example Input:
place_id	place_name	place_category
1	Baar Baar	Restaurant
2	Rubirosa	Restaurant
3	Mr. Purple	Bar
4	La Caverna	Bar

maps_ugc_review Table:
Column Name	Type
content_id	integer
place_id	integer
content_tag	varchar

maps_ugc_review Example Input:
content_id	place_id	content_tag
101	1	Off-topic
110	2	Misinformation
153	2	Off-topic
176	3	Harassment
190	3	Off-topic

Example Output:
